<h1>A (Generalized) Knight's Quest</h2>

<p>
A white knight finds itself on a chessboard, empty except for its mortal enemy: the black knight.
The white knight doesn't know how it got there. 
But that doesn't matter: the knight's instincts tell it that it must capture the black piece.
</p>
<p>
The knight moves by taking two steps in any direction followed by another step perpendicular to the first.
You can imagine it moving in an "L" shape. Possible moves are highlighted in green. 
The knight can also be returned to its starting position by clicking on it.
</p>

<p>
To the knight's suprise, his opponent doesn't move at all, a clear violation of the rules of chess.
Despite this, the knight is able to capture the other piece in as few as <b>five</b> moves with a bit of trial and error.
After trying and re-trying a few times, the knight starts to wonder: is there any way I can speed this up?
</p>
<p>
It turns out that <b>five</b> is the lower limit, at least for the way the knight moves right now. 
But since we already threw the rules of chess out the window, why not change the way knights can move as well?
</p>

<h2>New and Improved: The Generalized Knight</h2>

<p>
We've seen how knights move normally: <b>two</b> steps in one direction followed by <b>one</b> perpendicular step.
If we follow the same patterns but futz with the numbers a little bit, we can imagine a knight that takes <b>three</b>, then <b>two</b> perpendicular, steps, or <b>five</b> followed by <b>six</b> perpendicular.
In general, an <b>(a, b)</b>-knight takes <b>a</b> steps in any direction and then <b>b</b> steps in a perpendicular direction.
Our original knight was a <b>(1,2)</b>-knight, but we can replace those numbers with anything we want!
It's not too hard to see that if we flip the numbers, the moves we can make are the same, so in general we'll list the smaller number first.
</p>

<p>
With these new ways of moving available, the knight is giddy with excitement. Just think about how much faster we can get our job done now!
The first thing we'll try is doubling our speed: we'll try using a <b>(2,4)</b>-knight.
Surely this means we'll be able to capture twice as fast?
</p>

<div class="chessboard" id="game2"></div>

<p>
The white knight is distraught. By trying to speed up, now it can't capture the other piece at all! 
In fact, it seems like there's now a large number of pieces that are totally inaccessible. Why would that be?
For starters, we can't even move our knight to the same column as the other piece.
But that's not all: many other rows and columns are inaccessible as well.
</p>

<p>
The root of this issue comes from our initial choice of numbers. To see why this is a problem, let's number off the rows and columns.
We're starting in the first column and fourth row. When we make a move, we change one of these numbers by <b>two</b> and the other by <b>four</b>.
As a result, the column number will always be odd! This is why we can't capture the piece: it lives in the eighth column, which we can't reach by just adding even numbers.
</p>
<p>
In fact, this is true for all choices of <b>(a,b)</b> where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> have a factor in common.
The intuition behind this is that we will always be adding some multiple of this common factor to our coordinates.
If the coordinates of our target square aren't also a multiple of this common factor, the target square will be unreachable.
</p>

<p>
Okay, maybe doubling was too ambitious. Let's be conservative and try a <b>(1,3)</b>-knight. 
We can take bigger steps than we could at the start, but the numbers don't share any factors, so we avoid the trap we saw earlier.
</p>

<div class="chessboard" id="game3"></div> 

<p>
Looks like we're still running into the same problem. No matter what moves we take, we can't seem to capture the other piece (although we can get close).
Looking closer, it seems like our possible moves are always on black squares, while the other piece is on a white square.
For some reason, white squares are inaccessible.
